# React-Query

## Overview

React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze(轻而易举).

> 业界良好的实现总结而来，有点类似标准库一样

## Motivation

- Help you remove many lines of complicated and misunderstood code from your application and replace with just a handful of lines of React Query logic.
- Make your application more maintainable and easier to build new features without worrying about wiring up new server state data sources
- Have a direct impact on your end-users by making your application feel faster and more responsive than ever before.
- Potentially help you save on bandwidth and increase memory performance
