# React hooks: not magic, just arrays

## Unpacking how hooks work
### The rules of hooks
1. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions(**seem unnatural to program**)
2. Only Call Hooks from React Functions(**is self evident**)

### State management in hooks is all about arrays
Please note this is speculation and only one possible way of implementing the API to show how you might want to think about it. This is not necessarily how the API works internally.

### How could we implement `useState()` ?从手动实现入手

### So what’s React going to do with this?

### And the naive implementation

### Why order is important
